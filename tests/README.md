Note:

The current absence of traditional testing frameworks like Jest is a deliberate choice. While we fully recognize the importance of comprehensive testing and plan to implement proper E2E and unit tests in future iterations, our current approach serves two purposes:

1.  During these early stages of framework development, we're maintaining product demos and tests as a single unified experience

2.  This allows for rapid iteration and immediate visibility of how the framework behaves in real-world scenarios

As the framework matures, we'll transition to a more structured testing architecture. For now, this simplified approach helps us maintain development velocity while ensuring functionality through practical demonstrations.
